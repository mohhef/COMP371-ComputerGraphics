# COMP371-ComputerGraphics

## Description  
Introductionary OpengL programming assignment. This project revolves around creating virtual scenes which consists of several objects, all of which can be manipulated in various transformations. It also invovles setting up and manipulating a virtual camera and toggling between different sets of display (points, lines and solid). 

## Setup
The project directory contains source code, and external libraries and headers. Solution is setup to automatically include them upon load. 
Simply load the solution (ideally in `VS2019`) and run `main.cpp`.

## Inputs  

- W/S: displacement along Z-axis (must hold shift).
- A/D: displacement along X-axis (must hold shift).
- w/s: rotate model along X-axis.
- a/d: rotate model along Y-axis.
- P/L/T: toggle object display between point, line, and fill, respectively.
- U/J: scale model.
- UP/DOWN: rotate camera along X-axis.
- LEFT/RIGHT: rotate camera along Y-axis.
- 1/2/3: switch between models.
- SPACEBAR: reset model position.
- HOME: reset camera.
- LMB: zoom camera.
- RMB: pan camera.
- MMB: tilt camera.
- ESC: close window.
